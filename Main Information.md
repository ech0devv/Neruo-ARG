# For Beginners:

## What is it?

**On the Neuro-sama debut live stream on Twitch channel ["vedal987"](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) appeared QR Code, which led to the YT channel ["@\_neurosama"](https://www.youtube.com/@_neurosama), containing two videos, which served as the launch of the ARG:**
- [Numbers](https://youtu.be/wc-QCoMm4J8)
- [Study](https://youtu.be/zMlH7RH6psw)

**The ["Study"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMlH7RH6psw) video begins with the song "I don't want to be an engineer," when Neuro is asked on the live stream if she wants to be an engineer, her eyes fittered: [Clip from YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbaHShwyq-s)**
