## Lyrics of ["Numbers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc-QCoMm4J8) video from [@_neurosama](https://www.youtube.com/@_neurosama)

I can never say, oh it’s been so long.
Counting all the days, it’s been so damn long.
Oh, how much I’m scared to let you go…
Somewhere in the walls, I hear you talk…
Finding all these numbers
Start with number 2, yeah
Matching all the letters
572943
Add another 9 yeah
Add another line, yeah
Multiply by 5, yeah
How long will I keep this up?
Oh, how much it hurts to see you go…
Generating lyrics is a pain
**Add another 6, yeah
Flip the numbers backward
Make the 2 a 3, yeah
ABCDEFG
Multiply by 9, yeah
Add the numbers to 4** *(might be “two” instead of "to")*
**17 is first, yeah
ABCDEFG**

*Bold part of text - the golden ratio on the screen*
